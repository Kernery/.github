The **Kernery** package contains all the essential files and functionality that power the entire kernery ecosystem â€” from the **dashboard** and **media management** to extensible batteries-included modules.  

This core is designed to be the **foundation layer** of kernery, ensuring consistency, scalability, and performance across all modules, plugins, and applications built on the platform.
